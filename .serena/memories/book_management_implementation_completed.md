# Book Management Implementation Completed

## Date: 2025-08-17

## Summary
Successfully implemented book management features for the Reading Memory iOS app, including book listing, details, registration, and editing capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### Views Created
1. **BookListView**: Main book shelf view with grid layout
   - Displays user's book collection
   - Status filtering (All/Want to Read/Reading/Completed/DNF)
   - Search functionality
   - Empty state with call-to-action
   - Navigation to book details

2. **BookDetailView**: Book information display
   - Shows book cover, title, author, metadata
   - Status badge with color coding
   - Star rating display
   - Reading dates (started/finished)
   - Edit and delete options in toolbar

3. **BookRegistrationView**: Manual book entry form
   - Fields: title, author, ISBN, publisher, date, pages, description
   - Validation for required fields
   - Date picker integration
   - Loading state during save

4. **EditBookView**: Edit book status and rating
   - Status picker with smart date handling
   - Interactive star rating (0.5 increments)
   - Automatic date suggestions based on status changes
   - Form validation

### ViewModels Created
1. **BookRegistrationViewModel**: Handles book registration logic
   - Checks for existing books by ISBN
   - Creates new books or links existing ones
   - Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Services Created
1. **AuthService**: Centralized Firebase authentication
   - Singleton pattern for shared access
   - Resolves naming conflicts between Firebase and custom User models
   - Manages auth state listeners

### Key Technical Decisions
1. Used `@State` instead of `@StateObject` for iOS 17+ compatibility
2. Implemented proper Swift concurrency with `[weak self]` in closures
3. Used `withLoadingNoThrow` for async operations with loading states
4. Added explicit `id` parameter for ForEach with tuples
5. Updated deprecated APIs (foregroundColor → foregroundStyle)

### Build Issues Resolved
1. Fixed User model conflicts between FirebaseAuth.User and custom User
2. Added missing `authenticationRequired` case to AppError
3. Fixed Book initialization parameter order
4. Updated ViewModels to use proper capture semantics in closures
5. Fixed MainActor isolation issues in ServiceContainer

### Current Status
- All book management features implemented
- Build succeeds without errors
- Ready for testing in simulator
- Next task: Chat memo features (チャットメモ機能)

### Dependencies Updated
- ServiceContainer now includes all book-related ViewModels
- ContentView updated to show BookListView in main tab
- Repository methods properly integrated with ViewModels

### UI/UX Highlights
- Beautiful grid layout for book shelf
- Smooth navigation between views
- Consistent Japanese localization
- Loading states and error handling
- Smart form validations
