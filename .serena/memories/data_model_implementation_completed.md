# Data Model Implementation - Completed

## Date: 2025-01-17

### What was implemented:

1. **Core Data Models**
   - Book: Master book data (ISBN, title, author, publisher, etc.)
   - UserBook: User's personal book collection with status tracking
   - BookChat: Chat messages for each book
   - UserProfile: Extended user profile information
   
2. **Repository Pattern**
   - BaseRepository: Protocol with common functionality
   - BookRepository: CRUD operations for books
   - UserBookRepository: User's book collection management
   - BookChatRepository: Chat message operations with real-time listener
   - UserProfileRepository: User profile management

3. **Key Features**
   - Reading status enum (wantToRead, reading, completed, dnf)
   - Rating system (0.5 to 5.0 stars)
   - Chat messages with image support
   - AI flag for distinguishing AI responses
   - Public/private sharing options
   - Real-time chat synchronization

### Technical Implementation:
- All models conform to Identifiable and Codable
- Firestore integration with proper collection structure
- Singleton repositories for data access
- Async/await pattern throughout
- Proper error handling with throws
- Timestamp tracking (createdAt, updatedAt)

### Firestore Structure:
```
/users/{userId}
  - Basic user auth data
/userProfiles/{userId}
  - Extended profile data
/books/{bookId}
  - Master book data (shared across users)
/users/{userId}/userBooks/{userBookId}
  - User's personal book collection
/users/{userId}/userBooks/{userBookId}/chats/{chatId}
  - Chat messages for each book
```

### Build Status: ✅ Successfully building

### Next Steps According to task-sheet.md:
- Phase 1: アーキテクチャ実装 (Architecture Implementation)
  - ViewModel base class
  - DI container setup
  - Error handling
  - Network layer
