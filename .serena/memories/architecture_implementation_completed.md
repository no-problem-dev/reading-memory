# Architecture Implementation - Completed

## Date: 2025-01-17

### What was implemented:

1. **BaseViewModel Class**
   - Created a base class for all ViewModels with common functionality
   - Includes isLoading, errorMessage, showError properties
   - Provides withLoading() and withLoadingNoThrow() helper methods
   - Centralized error handling with handleError() and clearError()
   - Uses @MainActor and @Observable pattern (iOS 17+)

2. **Dependency Injection Container**
   - Created ServiceContainer as a singleton
   - Provides factory methods for creating ViewModels
   - Lazy initialization of repositories
   - Centralized dependency management
   - Added placeholder ViewModels (BookListViewModel, BookDetailViewModel, ProfileViewModel)

3. **Error Handling System**
   - Created AppError enum with comprehensive error cases
   - Localized error messages in Japanese
   - Error conversion from various sources (Firebase, Network, etc.)
   - Recovery suggestions for certain errors
   - Integrated with BaseViewModel for consistent error display

4. **Network Layer Abstraction**
   - Created NetworkService with protocol-based design
   - Supports all HTTP methods through Endpoint struct
   - Automatic error handling and conversion to AppError
   - JSON decoding with proper date handling
   - Example implementation for Google Books API endpoints

### Technical Implementation:
- Updated AuthViewModel to extend BaseViewModel
- Fixed actor isolation issues with auth listener cleanup
- Used weak self capture in async closures
- Build status: ✅ Successfully building

### Architecture Benefits:
- Consistent error handling across the app
- Testable code with dependency injection
- Reusable network layer for API calls
- Reduced boilerplate in ViewModels
- Clear separation of concerns

### Next Steps According to task-sheet.md:
- Phase 1: 本の管理機能 (Book Management Features)
  - Book manual registration screen
  - Book detail display
  - Status management
  - Rating feature
  - Edit/delete functionality
