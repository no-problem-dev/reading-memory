# UserBook Structure Refactoring

## Date: 2025-08-17

## Summary
Refactored the UserBook model to include Book data directly, eliminating the need for UserBookWithBook wrapper and removing BookListView in favor of BookShelfView.

## Changes Made

### 1. UserBook Model Update
- Added `book: Book?` property to UserBook
- Updated CodingKeys and initializer
- Book data is now fetched and stored directly in UserBook

### 2. Removed UserBookWithBook
- Deleted the intermediate model that combined UserBook and Book
- Simplified data structure and reduced complexity

### 3. Removed BookListView
- Deleted BookListView.swift as it was replaced by BookShelfView
- BookShelfView provides better visual presentation with grid layout

### 4. Updated BookShelfViewModel
- Changed to use UserBook directly instead of UserBookWithBook
- Fetches Book data and creates UserBook instances with embedded Book
- Filters out UserBooks without associated Book data

### 5. Updated BookCoverView
- Changed to accept UserBook instead of UserBookWithBook
- Added EmptyBookCover for cases where Book data is missing
- Uses optional chaining for accessing book properties

### 6. Refactored BookDetailView
- Changed to accept userBookId instead of userBook and book
- Loads UserBook data asynchronously on view appear
- Simplified architecture with single data loading point

### 7. Updated ServiceContainer
- Changed makeBookDetailViewModel to accept only UserBook
- BookDetailViewModel init updated accordingly

## Benefits
- Cleaner data model without redundant wrapper types
- Simpler view parameter passing
- More consistent data flow
- Better separation of concerns with async loading in views

## Technical Notes
- UserBook now contains optional Book data
- Views handle nil book gracefully with appropriate UI
- Async loading pattern used in BookDetailView
- Maintains backward compatibility with Firestore structure
