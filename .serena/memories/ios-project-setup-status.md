# iOS Project Setup Status

## Project Structure
- iOS project successfully created at `/Users/kyoichi/Develop/reading-memory/reading-memory-ios`
- Integrated into main repository (not as submodule)
- Using Xcode 16.2 with iOS 17.0 deployment target

## Architecture
- **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** architecture implemented
- Clean separation between domain models and infrastructure
- Domain models do not depend on Firebase
- Repository pattern prepared for data access

## Dependencies Added
- Firebase SDK (Core, Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions)
- Google Sign-In SDK
- No FirebaseFirestoreSwift (deprecated/removed)

## Key Files Created
1. **Models** (Domain layer - no Firebase dependencies)
   - `User.swift` - User domain model
   - `Book.swift` - Book domain model  
   - `ChatMemo.swift` - Chat memo domain model
   - `ReadingSession.swift` - Reading session model

2. **ViewModels**
   - `AuthViewModel.swift` - Authentication state management with @Observable

3. **Views**
   - `ContentView.swift` - Main navigation based on auth state
   - `AuthView.swift` - Login screen with Google/Apple Sign-In UI

4. **Repositories** (Infrastructure layer)
   - `UserRepository.swift` - Protocol definition
   - `FirebaseUserRepository.swift` - Firebase implementation

5. **App Configuration**
   - `reading_memory_iosApp.swift` - Firebase initialization
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist` - Firebase config (user placed)
   - `Info.plist` - Added for Google Sign-In URL scheme

## Build Configuration
- Successfully builds for iOS Simulator
- Makefile created with commands:
  - `make ios-build` - Build for simulator
  - `make ios-build-device` - Build for device
  - `make ios-clean` - Clean build artifacts

## Important Notes
- No header comments in files (per user preference)
- iOS deployment target: 17.0 (changed from 18.2)
- Google Sign-In SDK added to project
- Entitlements file created for Sign in with Apple

## Next Steps
- Implement Google Sign-In authentication flow
- Implement Apple Sign-In authentication flow
- Create book management features
- Implement chat memo functionality
- Add reading session tracking
